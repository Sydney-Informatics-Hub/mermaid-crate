mermaid-crate
=============

🧜‍♀️📦

Experiment in taking a diagram defined in [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) 
and turning it into part of an [RO-Crate JSON-LD graph](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), to make it easier to 
make Crates which capture data science workflows which you've already
documented.

Not even alpha yet!
